# Sunrise Countdown

Welcome to my Sunrise App.
https://gcaliene.github.io/Thinkful-Sunrise-App-Capstone/

There are many sunrise apps out there but many require more input than a push of a button.

My application uses an api to get your location via your ip address and then it retrieves the sunrise information from an API using an AJAX call. 

This app was used using moment.js, jQuery, AJAX/JSON, and HTML/CSS.

#### Initially I had a button set up to acquire permission for the exact location of the individual but I felt this was too much as retrieving the geolocation via ip was less intrusive and offered a smoother flow.

# API-Capstone

Welcome to my Sunrise App.

There are many sunset/sunrise apps out there but many require more input than a push of a button.

My Web App simply asks for permission to get your geolocation and it gets the sunrise information from an API using an AJAX call. 

This app was used using CSS media queries, moment.js, jQuery, AJAX/JSON, and HTML.
